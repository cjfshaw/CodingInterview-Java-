Problems that were difficult:
Chapter 1
Q3: The logic of the loop took me way too long. Specifically the concept of i going up while the position in the list
went down.
Q4: Do the bonus part
Q5: Took FAR too long. I overcomplicated how I was doing it by trying to make one function that checked for any single
change rather than one to check for inserts, one for removals, etc. Thinking of how to test helped with this. DON'T
WORRY ABOUT HAVING A LOT OF LINES, JUST GET A SOLUTION FIRST. You can optimize after you've solved it. Done it better
than perfect.
C7: Don't understand, got solution from book.
